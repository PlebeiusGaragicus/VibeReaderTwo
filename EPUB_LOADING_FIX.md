# EPUB Loading Fix

## Problem

EPUB.js was trying to access internal EPUB files directly via URL:
```
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/1/META-INF/container.xml 404 (Not Found)
```

This caused the error: `Error: Book not rendered`

## Root Cause

When you pass a URL to `ePub(url)`, EPUB.js expects the server to:
1. Extract the EPUB archive
2. Serve individual files from within the EPUB
3. Support requests like `/path/to/epub/META-INF/container.xml`

Our backend serves the EPUB as a **downloadable file** (blob), not as an extracted directory structure.

## Solution

Download the EPUB file as a blob first, then pass the ArrayBuffer to EPUB.js:

**Before:**
```typescript
const epubUrl = bookApiService.getBookFileUrl(bookId);
this.book = ePub(epubUrl);  // ❌ Tries to access internal files via URL
```

**After:**
```typescript
const epubUrl = bookApiService.getBookFileUrl(bookId);

// Download as blob
const response = await fetch(epubUrl);
const blob = await response.blob();
const arrayBuffer = await blob.arrayBuffer();

// Load from ArrayBuffer
this.book = ePub(arrayBuffer);  // ✅ EPUB.js extracts internally
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Frontend** requests EPUB file from API
2. **Backend** serves complete EPUB file as blob
3. **Frontend** downloads entire file
4. **EPUB.js** extracts and parses the EPUB in memory
5. **Book renders** successfully

## Benefits

- ✅ Works with any backend that serves files as blobs
- ✅ No need for backend to extract EPUBs
- ✅ Simpler backend implementation
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Progress tracking during download

## Testing

```bash
# 1. Restart frontend to load new code
./start-dev.sh  # Choose option 4

# 2. Click on a book

# 3. Check console logs
# Should see:
# ℹ️ EPUB Loading book ID: 1
# ℹ️ EPUB Fetching EPUB from: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/1/file
# ℹ️ EPUB Downloaded EPUB: 2.45MB
# ℹ️ EPUB Book loaded and parsed successfully
```
