# New Features Added

## ✅ SHA256 Hash & Duplicate Detection

### What It Does
- Calculates SHA256 hash of each EPUB file during import
- Stores hash in database for future comparison
- Prevents importing the same book twice

### How It Works
1. When you import an EPUB, the app calculates its SHA256 hash
2. Checks if a book with the same hash already exists
3. If duplicate found, shows error: "This book is already in your library: [Title] by [Author]"
4. If unique, imports the book normally

### Technical Details
- Hash calculated using Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle.digest`)
- Database schema upgraded to version 2 with `fileHash` index
- Hash stored as hex string (64 characters)

### Console Output
```
Starting EPUB import for: book.epub
Calculating file hash...
File hash: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
Duplicate book found: Book Title
Error: This book is already in your library: "Book Title" by Author Name
```

```
