# Navigation & Context Menu Updates

## ✅ Improved Page Navigation

### What Changed
- **Before**: Full-width click zones covered the entire page (blocked text selection)
- **After**: Navigation zones only in the left/right margins (80px wide each side)

### How It Works Now

#### Margin Navigation Zones
- **Left margin** (80px): Click to go to previous page
- **Right margin** (80px): Click to go to next page
- **Center area**: Text selection works normally!

#### Visual Feedback
- Hover over margins → Chevron arrows appear
- Cursor changes to `←` (left) or `→` (right)
- Subtle background highlight on hover

#### Text Selection
- Click and drag in the main text area works perfectly
- No interference from navigation zones
- Selection menu appears as before

### Benefits
✅ Text selection no longer conflicts with page navigation
✅ Clear visual indication of navigation zones
✅ More intuitive user experience
✅ Keyboard navigation (arrow keys) still works

             group"
>
  <ChevronLeft className="opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100" />
</button>

// Right margin (80px wide)
<button
  className="absolute right-0 top-0 bottom-0 w-20

</button>
```
