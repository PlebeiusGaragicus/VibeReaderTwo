The user will log in with their Nostr key.  The nos2x Chrome extension will be used and the "profile" will be the user's public key.

Let's focus on dark mode first - all UI elements should be designed for dark-mode.

The main content area will be the reader.

Similarly to VS Code and Obsidian, a collapsable navbar on the left displays icons for Library, Annotations, Chat, Search and Settings.

Once text is selected a context menu will appear with options to create an annotation: note, highlight or be used as context for a chat.  Notes are yellow, highlights are green and chats are blue (by default)

Annotations will be displayed as a list with a preview of the annotation while notes, hightlights and chats will be visually distinct and showcase their chosen color.  Clicking on an annotation will scroll to it in the viewer.
