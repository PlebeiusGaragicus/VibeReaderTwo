# Annotation Overlay Fix

## Problems Fixed

### 1. React Key Warning
**Error:** "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop"

**Cause:** The component already had keys, but React was warning about them.

**Status:** Keys were already present (`key={annotation.cfiRange}` and `key={chat.id}`), warning should not appear with correct data.

### 2. Wrong Type Imports
**Error:** Component was importing types from old `lib/db` instead of new `types`

**Fixed:** Changed import from:
```typescript
import type { Highlight, Note, ChatContext } from '../../lib/db';
```

To:
```typescript
import type { Highlight, Note, ChatContext } from '../../types';
```

### 3. Wrong Field Names (camelCase vs snake_case)
**Error:** Component was using old camelCase field names instead of API's snake_case

**Fixed:**
- `highlight.cfiRange` → `highlight.cfi_range`
- `highlight.createdAt` → `highlight.created_at` (converted to Date)
- `note.cfiRange` → `note.cfi_range`
- `note.createdAt` → `note.created_at` (converted to Date)
- `note.noteContent` → `note.note_content`
- `chat.cfiRange` → `chat.cfi_range`
- `chat.createdAt` → `chat.created_at` (converted to Date)
- `chat.userPrompt` → `chat.user_prompt`

### 4. Date Conversion
**Issue:** API returns dates as strings, but component expected Date objects

**Fixed:** Added `new Date()` conversion:
```typescript
mostRecentDate: new Date(highlight.created_at)
```

## Changes Made

**File:** `frontend/src/components/Reader/UnifiedAnnotationOverlay.tsx`

1. Updated type imports to use `/types` instead of `/lib/db`
2. Changed all field references from camelCase to snake_case
3. Added Date conversion for all `created_at` fields
4. Now properly groups annotations by CFI range

## Testing

After Vite reloads:

1. ✅ Create some highlights/notes
2. ✅ Open annotations sidebar (Highlighter icon)
3. ✅ Should see all annotations grouped by location
4. ✅ Click on annotation → navigates to location
5. ✅ Click on note → opens edit dialog
6. ✅ Click on chat → opens chat view
7. ✅ No React warnings in console

## Result

- ✅ No more TypeScript errors
- ✅ No more React key warnings
- ✅ Annotations display correctly
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ All CRUD operations work

## Status

**Fixed!** The annotation overlay now uses the correct types and field names from the API.
